Hello there! Here are some helpful information about the BusBot.

Please make your console (the display at the bottom) larger since
there is quite a bit of text, and when the bot loops it will be
easier to use the menu. 

I've used the Mountainline Green Buses ever since I started 
studying in WVU as my main method of transportation. A lot 
of people have trouble in determining which line to use so 
I've developed this simple bot that tells you which line to use.

Since there are a lot of stops, I've included the ones that
the students here use the most as well as included the most
popular bus lines. 

I've implemented all of the concepts we have learned in class 
so far, from constructors, if else statements and etc. I have
also added some new things such as the BufferedReader, try, 
System.err, catch and other things. 

This was my first Java project on eclipse and I tried my 
best to make it interactive. It was a challenge to make
and I am happy with what I have made. Any feedback would
be appreciated so that I can make the bot better. 

Thank you very much for trying out my BusBot.
